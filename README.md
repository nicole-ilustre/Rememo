Rememo: a tool that guarantees your team understands the information you send.

Important internal emails and memos are often not being understood completely which can really hurt a business. REMEMO solves this problem with software that tests the reader's comprehension with short questions, thereby giving the sender's confidence that the team has read and understood the information completely.
